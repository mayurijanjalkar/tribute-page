                About the Legend
            </h1>
            <p>
                ☛  He was a philosopher, author, and the second President of India.His birthday is celebrated as Teachers Day across the country.<br><br>
                ☛ Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was a scholar, politician, philosopher, and statesman from India. He served as India's first Vice President and second President.<br><br>
                ☛ Radhakrishnan spent his life and career as a writer attempting to describe, defend, and propagate his faith, which he referred to variously as Hinduism, Vedanta, and the religion of the Spirit. He wanted to show that his Hinduism was philosophically sound as well as ethically viable. He often seems to be at ease in both Indian and Western philosophical contexts, and he draws on both Western and Indian sources in his prose. 
                As a result, Radhakrishnan has been hailed as a symbol of Hinduism to the West in academic circles.<br><br>
                In this biography of Sarvepalli Radha Krishnan, we will learn about his early life and family, his education, his career as a teacher, his political life, and his death.
